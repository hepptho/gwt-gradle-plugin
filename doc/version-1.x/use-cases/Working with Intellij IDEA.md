# Working with Intellij IDEA (v1)

Intellij IDEA has very good support for Gradle projects, so it's easy to import Gradle projects into Inteiij IDEA.

It's recommended that you should always use Gradle wrapper in your Gradle projects. When importing into IDEA, please choose "Use default gradle wrapper (recommended)".
